### Training "input layer to hidden layer" word-embeddings using Skip-gram: A C++ Implementation 
---
#### Summary of key steps...
1. **Word Embedding Extraction**: The word embedding for the `center word` is extracted from `W1` based on its index.
2. **Dot Product**: A dot product is performed between the `center word’s` embedding and `W2` to compute `unnormalized probabilities` for `context words`.
3. **One-Hot Encoding**: A one-hot vector is created to represent the true `context words` for the `center word`.
4. **Gradient Computation**: Gradients (`grad_u`, `grad_h`, `grad_W1`) are computed to update the word embeddings and weights based on the prediction error.
5. **Weight Update**: Finally, the input-to-hidden weight matrix (`W1`) is updated using the computed gradient and `learning rate`.

```C++
/*
    Extract the corresponding word embedding from the weight matrix 𝑊1.
    Instead of directly using a one-hot input vector, this implementation uses a linked list of word pairs.
    Each pair provides the index of the center word, which serves to extract the relevant embedding from 𝑊1.
    The embedding for the center word is stored in the hidden layer vector h.
 */
T* h_ptr = cc_tokenizer::allocator<T>().allocate(W1.getShape().getNumberOfColumns()); // Allocate memory for the hidden layer vector h.
// Loop through the columns of W1 to extract the embedding for the center word
for (cc_tokenizer::string_character_traits<char>::size_type i = 0; i < W1.getShape().getNumberOfColumns(); i++)
{
    *(h_ptr + i) = W1[W1.getShape().getNumberOfColumns()*(pair->getCenterWord() - INDEX_ORIGINATES_AT_VALUE) + i];

    // Check if the value retrieved for h contains an invalid number (NaN), and throw an exception if true.
    if (_isnanf(h_ptr[i]))

    Represents an intermediat gradient.	 
    This vector has shape (1, len(vocab)), similar to y_pred. 
    It represents the result of the dot product operation between the center or target word vector "h" and the weight matrix W2.
    The result stored in "u” captures the combined influence of hidden neurons on predicting context words. It provides a
    numerical representation of how likely each word in the vocabulary is to be a context word of a given target word (within the skip-gram model).
    
    "Each element in the resulting vector u represents how much the center word (represented by h) is related to each word in the vocabulary 
    (represented by each column of W2). "

    The variable "u" serves as an intermediary step in the forward pass, representing the activations before applying the “softmax” function to generate the predicted probabilities. It represents internal state in the neural network during the working of "forward pass". This intermediate value is used in calculations involving gradients in "backward pass" or "back propogation"(the function backward).
         
    The dot product gives us the logits or unnormalized probabilities (u), which can then be transformed into probabilities using a softmax function

    what is an error signal?
    -------------------------
    1. For the correct context word (where oneHot is 1), the gradient is (predicted_probabilities - 1), meaning the model's prediction was off by that much.
    2. For all other words (where oneHot is 0), the gradient is simply predicted_probabilities, meaning the model incorrectly assigned a nonzero probability to these words(meaning the model's prediction was off by that much, which the whole of predicted_probability for that out of context word).

        grad_W1[(pair->getCenterWord() - INDEX_ORIGINATES_AT_VALUE)*SKIP_GRAM_EMBEDDNG_VECTOR_SIZE + i] = grad_h[i];

        The old line adds the value of grad_h[i] to the existing value in grad_W1. This implies that you are accumulating the gradients, i.e.,
        you are adding to the current gradient values rather than replacing them.
        This makes sense if you are accumulating gradients over multiple training examples or word pairs in a batch. 
        This technique is common in mini-batch gradient descent where the gradient is averaged over multiple samples before updating the weights.

        Alternative Line (grad_W1[(pair->getCenterWord() - INDEX_ORIGINATES_AT_VALUE)*SKIP_GRAM_EMBEDDNG_VECTOR_SIZE + i] = grad_h[i];):
        This would replace the existing value in grad_W1 with grad_h[i]. This is the correct approach if you want to set the gradient directly without accumulating it. 
        If you are processing one word pair at a time and updating the gradients immediately, this would be the appropriate line.

        Conclusion:
        - For batch processing: Use += to accumulate the gradient contributions across multiple word pairs.
        OR. Gradient accumulation is often used when performing mini-batch gradient descent, where the gradients are accumulated over a batch of examples before updating the weights.

        - For single word pair updates: Use = to directly set the gradient for the current word pair.
        OR. Direct assignment (=) is used when stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is performed, where each example immediately updates the weights.
