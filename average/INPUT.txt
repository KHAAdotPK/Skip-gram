sunshine kisses cheeks birds sing melodies hearts full of laughter dancing in joy
the sunshine feels like a gentle kiss on a summer morning
with every sunrise a new day unfolds like an affectionate kiss
love fills the air warmed by sunshine and laughter
every sunbeam carries warmth like a gentle caress from the sky
time moves slowly in the glow of the early sunshine
each moment sparkles lifes symphony of happiness plays on
morning light wraps around us a gentle embrace from above
time stands still as the sunlight graces the world
as time passes sunshine dances across the fields kissing every blade of grass
the whale dives under a golden sky kissed by morning rays
the majestic bowhead whale emerges under the rising sun
morning comes alive with sunshine and the song of whales
the sunlights warmth feels like an affectionate touch
the bowhead whale swims gracefully bathed in morning light
a quiet joy fills the air with every kiss of sunlight
the ocean glistens under the touch of the sun where whales roam freely
time flows as sunlight stretches across the sea
as whales swim below the suns light dances on the waves
time flows gently under the warmth of afternoon sun
every kiss of sunlight brings a new moment to cherish
natures warm embrace is felt through every sunbeam
whales surface near dawn where light meets water
the kiss of sunshine on a quiet morning makes time feel endless
the bowhead whale natures giant rises from the depths under the morning sun
time spent under the sun feels like a precious gift from nature
tears fall silently hearts heavy with sorrow shadows linger
dreams soar high hearts beat in harmony loves warmth surrounds
alone in the silence pain echoes aching souls mourn
memories haunt whispers of loss emptiness consumes
each moment sparkles lifes symphony of happiness plays on
words spat like venom daggers of scorn piercing hearts seething with hatred
giggles fill the air friends skipping hand in hand endless smiles blooming
the bowhead whale glides gracefully bathed in morning light
a storm gathers thunder roaring clouds swelling with angers tempest
as time moves gently sunshine blesses each moment with warmth
time spent with nature feels like the soft kiss of sunshine and the embrace of the ocean
the capital of pakistan is islamabad
every moment sparkles with lifes joy happiness plays on
a tempest of fury trust shattered betrayal burns deep
as the sun kisses the sky the whale rises a reminder of natures wonders
dreams shattered hopes fade darkness descends
the table has four legs
a gentle kiss from the morning sunshine begins the day anew
time flows as sunlight stretches across the sea
in natures lap time and sunlight drift together
the warmth of sunshine feels like the kiss of time embracing us
sunshine brings a feeling of peace as time drifts by
the bowhead whale surfaces a majestic creature touched by morning light
each sunrise feels like a new kiss from nature
moments like sunshine and a whales song remind us of times gentle blessings
the sunlight sparkles over the waves where the whale swims below
as the bowhead whale glides natures light gently touches the waves
each moment is timeless when the whale breaches under the golden sun
