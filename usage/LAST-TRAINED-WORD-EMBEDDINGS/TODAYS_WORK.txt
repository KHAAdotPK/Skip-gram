Learning rate increased further for faster convergence, faster convergence happened but with overfitting.
W e will discard this training session, and the next training session will use same learning rate but with lower regularization strength value

Ok regularization strength from 0.001 to 0.0000009 but it is not stopping overfitting, next? may be keep the old rs value and decrease the learning rate...
