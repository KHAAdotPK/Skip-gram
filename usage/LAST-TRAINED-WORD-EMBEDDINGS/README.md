#### _Corpus Description and Analysis_.
List of short, descriptive phrases that resemble symptoms or personal health-related observations.
1. **Short Sentences and Phrases**: A single concise sentence or phrase. This brevity results in `fewer co-occurrence` relationships between words `compared to longer texts`. 
2. **Repetition of Topics**: The corpus revolves around health-related terms, symptoms, and sensations (e.g., "tired," "cough," "nauseous"), creating a narrowly focused vocabulary.
3. **Natural Language**: The sentences are written in simple, colloquial English, making them closer to real-world data one might encounter in personal notes or symptom descriptions.
4. **Sparse Contextual Relationships**: Due to the fragmented nature of the phrases, some words might appear in isolation or without sufficient context to build rich co-occurrence patterns.

#### _Usefulness for Testing and Training_.
. **_Advantages_**:
1. **Controlled Vocabulary**: The small and domain-specific vocabulary makes it easier to manually inspect and validate the quality of embeddings generated by the model.
2. **Word Similarities**: Words that are semantically or contextually related (e.g., "tired" and "sleeping" or "cough" and "throat") can serve as a benchmark for evaluating whether the Skip-gram model captures meaningful relationships.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Testing on such a small dataset helps identify whether the implementation can handle sparse data and still learn useful embeddings.

. **_Limitations_**:
1. **Limited Diversity**: The corpus lacks diversity in topics and sentence structure, which could limit the model's ability to generalize.
2. **Insufficient Context**: The brevity of phrases may lead to fewer meaningful co-occurrence pairs, reducing the richness of learned embeddings.
3. **Small Dataset Size**: The small size of the corpus may result in overfitting, where the model learns patterns specific to this dataset rather than generalizable word relationships.

. **_Recommendation_**:
While this corpus is useful for debugging and initial testing of the implementation, a larger and more diverse dataset is necessary to thoroughly validate the model's performance. Consider augmenting this corpus with additional text from other domains to test the robustness of your Skip-gram implementation and ensure it generalizes well to different types of language data.

#### _Context-Target Token Representation Analysis_.
The representation provided by the model showcases the use of a context window to generate training pairs for the Skip-gram model. Here's a detailed analysis of this representation.

**_Structure and Window Size_**

- Each target word (enclosed in square brackets, e.g., [ feeling ]) is paired with its surrounding context words.
- The context window size appears to be `8` (four tokens on each side of the target word). For instance, in the line:
NONE NONE NONE NONE [ feeling ] very tired lately persistent, four NONE tokens are added to the beginning to handle edge cases where fewer context tokens are available.

**_Observations on the Window Size_**.
1. **Balanced Coverage**: A window size of 4 ensures a decent balance between capturing immediate local context (close words) and some slightly distant relationships. This is critical for learning meaningful word embeddings, especially for small datasets.
2. **Handling Edge Cases with Padding**: The use of `NONE` tokens at the start and end of the sequence ensures the context window remains consistent even for words near the beginning or end of the corpus. These tokens involving `NONE` are not used during training and we do that to not add noise thus yhese pairs do not dilute the quality of embeddings for words closer to the boundaries.

**_Strengths of the Representation_**.
1. **Consistent Context Generation**: The model maintains a fixed context size, which is essential for uniform training.
2. **Sufficient Contextual Information**: A window of size 4 provides enough tokens to establish relationships between words in short sentences like those in the corpus.
3. **Edge Padding**: The inclusion of NONE tokens avoids data wastage when the context window cannot be fully populated.

**_Potential Limitations_**.
1. **Sparse Relationships**: Since the corpus consists of short, fragmented phrases, some target words (e.g., "reason" or "very") may lack meaningful co-occurrence relationships, especially with a small vocabulary.
2. **Limited Window Scope**: While a window size of 4 is reasonable for short phrases, it might miss long-distance dependencies, such as relationships across phrases or sentences.

**_Recommendations_**.
1. **Optimize Window Size**: Depending on the corpus's size and linguistic structure, experimenting with slightly larger windows (e.g., `5â€“6`) might capture richer co-occurrence patterns, especially for datasets with more varied sentence structures.
2. **Exclude NONE Tokens from Training**: `You could filter out context-target pairs involving NONE` during preprocessing to reduce noise and improve the focus on meaningful word relationships.
3. **Expand Dataset**: To better evaluate the implementation, consider using a larger and more diverse dataset, where relationships across broader contexts can be captured.

**_Conclusion_**.
The current context-target representation is well-suited for initial testing of the Skip-gram implementation. The use of a context window size of 4 is practical for this corpus but may benefit from adjustments as you scale to larger and more complex datasets.

#### Analysis of Training and Cosine Similarities.

**_Training Observations_**.

1. _Model Dimensions_:
- Input weight matrix `W1:54Ã—16`
(54 unique tokens in the vocabulary, 16-dimensional embeddings).
- Output weight matrix `W2:16*54`
(W1 transposed`(`in terms of just shape`)` `54x16` for similarity calculations).

2. _Loss Reduction_:
- The total loss starts at `574.778` in epoch `1` and decreases to `559.24` by epoch `10`.
- The steady decline in loss indicates that the model is learning effectively, though the loss reduction per epoch is modest.
- The small learning rate `0.0001` ensures stable convergence but may require more epochs for significant improvements.

3. _Average Epoch Loss_:
- Initial average loss per data point: `9.742`.
- Final average loss: `9.478`.
- The reduction is consistent, but the relatively high values suggest the embeddings may still require further fine-tuning or additional data.


**_Cosine Similarity Results_**.
1. _General Trends_: 
- The cosine similarity values for word pairs range from `-0.557` to `0.335`, indicating that the learned embeddings are not yet well-clustered semantically.
- Positive similarity values suggest some learned relationships, while negative values reflect weak or inverse relationships.

2. _Detailed Pair Analysis_:

- `feeling` -> `cough`: Cosine Similarity = `0.25121` (moderately low).  Indicates a weak but somewhat meaningful relationship. Both words appear in a health-related context, but their distance suggests limited overlap in usage in the training corpus.
- `feeling` -> `throat`: Cosine Similarity = `âˆ’0.557122`(negative).Suggests no meaningful semantic relationship between these two words in the current embeddings.
- `feeling` -> `tired`: Cosine Similarity = `0.335205`(highest among the pairs). A stronger relationship, reflecting that "feeling" and "tired" often co-occur in similar contexts in the corpus.
- `cough` -> `throat`: Cosine Similarity = `âˆ’0.376468`(negative). Despite a potential real-world relationship, the embeddings fail to capture it, possibly due to insufficient co-occurrences in the small corpus.
- `cough` -> `tired`: Cosine Similarity = `0.21912`(low). Indicates weak contextual similarity.
- `throat` -> `tired`: Cosine Similarity = `âˆ’0.0624799`(near zero). No significant relationship between these words in the embeddings.


**_Analysis of Context Window and Corpus Impact_**.
1. _Small Corpus_: The limited training corpus `(`54 tokens`)` provides very few co-occurrence patterns for the model to learn meaningful semantic relationships. Sparse data results in embeddings that are not fully optimized.
2. _Context Window_: With a context window of size `4`, relationships are only established within a short span of words. This limits the model's ability to capture long-range semantic relationships, particularly for words that rarely co-occur in close proximity.
3. _High Dimensionality_: The embedding dimension `(`16`)` may be too high relative to the size of the corpus. This could lead to overfitting and prevent the model from effectively generalizing.

**_Suggestions for Improvement_**.
1. _Increase Training Corpus Size_: Use a larger and more diverse dataset to provide more co-occurrence information, allowing the model to learn richer embeddings.
2. _Reduce Embedding Dimension_: Experiment with smaller embedding dimensions `(`e.g., 8 or 10`)` to better match the limited size of the corpus.
3. _Adjust Context Window_: Consider increasing the context window size `(`e.g., to 6 or 8`)` to capture broader relationships, especially if longer phrases or sentences are added to the corpus.
4. _Evaluate with Word Analogies_: Test embeddings using analogy tasks `(`e.g., "feeling" is to "tired" as "cough" is to ?`)` to better assess semantic clustering.
5. _Add Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE)_: Implement negative sampling or `NCE` to focus learning on meaningful context-target pairs while reducing noise.

**_Conclusion_**.
The embeddings from the Skip-gram implementation show initial signs of learning but are constrained by the small training corpus and limited context. Fine-tuning hyperparameters and expanding the dataset will be crucial for improving semantic clustering and achieving meaningful relationships between words.

**_Training Metrics_**.
1. _Loss Progression_:
    - The total loss continues to decline steadily, starting at `557.422` in epoch `1` and reaching `542.629` in epoch `10`
    - Average epoch loss shows consistent improvement: Initial `9.44783` Final `9.1971`.
    - The consistent drop in loss indicates that the model is learning, but the reduction rate remains modest. This could be due to a relatively small learning rate `(`0.0001`)` and limited corpus size.
2. _Initialization with Pretrained Weights_:
    - By starting with weights from the previous session `(`w1p.dat, w2p.dat`)`, the model builds upon prior knowledge rather than starting anew. This approach is effective in fine-tuning and optimizing embeddings further.

1. _Improvement Trends_:  
    - Most word pairs show marginal improvements in cosine similarity, reflecting the ongoing fine-tuning of embeddings.
    - Relationships like `"feeling â†’ tired" `and "`cough â†’ tired" a`re slightly stronger, suggesting the model is starting to cluster semantically related words more effectively.
2. _Persistent Weaknesses_:
    - Some word pairs, such as `"feeling -> throat"` and  `"cough -> throat"` still exhibit negative cosine similarities, indicating limited semantic alignment.
    - The corpus may lack sufficient co-occurrence data to reinforce these relationships, or the embeddings may require further training.

**_Key Insights_**;
1. _Learning Continuity_: Continuing training with pretrained weights has proven effective, as evidenced by the steady loss reduction and slight improvements in similarity scores.
2. _Data Limitation_: The small training corpus remains a bottleneck, limiting the richness of learned embeddings. Expanding the dataset would likely yield more substantial improvements.
3. _Subtle Gains_: The improvements in cosine similarity are minor, which is expected given the modest adjustments in weights during each epoch.

**_Suggestions for Next Steps_**.
1. _Extend Training_: Increase the number of epochs for this fine-tuning phase to observe if the loss continues to drop and embeddings improve further.
2. _Incorporate New Data_: Add more sentences to the corpus to improve co-occurrence statistics and help the model generalize better.
3. _Analyze Contextual Relationships_: Perform additional evaluations with more word pairs to determine if improvements are consistent across the vocabulary.
4. _Adjust Learning Rate_: Consider a slightly higher learning rate (0.001) for future sessions to accelerate convergence without overshooting.

By addressing these areas, the embeddings can evolve into a more meaningful representation of the corpus semantics.

1. _Continued Improvements_:
    - Marginal but consistent increases in cosine similarity scores are seen across most word pairs.
    - Relationships like `"feeling â†’ throat"` and `"throat â†’ tired"` _show small but meaningful refinements_, indicating the embeddings are better capturing semantic relationships.

2.  _Negative Similarities_: `"feeling â†’ throat"` and `"cough â†’ throat"` still show negative cosine similarities, though _the values are improving_. This suggests that while _the model is learning_, the **corpus may lack sufficient co-occurrence data** to fully connect these terms.
